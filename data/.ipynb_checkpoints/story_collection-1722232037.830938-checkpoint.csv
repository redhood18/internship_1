Troubleshooting  
If you are having trouble with the function of your modem, review the 
following sections for information that may help you discover the source of the problem and/or how to fix it.  
Connecting the modem power cord  
The HT2000W power cord connector uses a locking mechanism to ensure it stays snugly connected to the modem. Make sure the connector is oriented correctly when plugging it  into the DC IN port; the flat side of the plug 
should face the modem’s side panel  nearest to the port . 
Figure 10 shows the correct position of the  power cord connector. When 
connecting the power cord, you must push the connector into the DC IN 
port.  This creates a locking connection between the power cord and the 
modem.  
 
Figure 10:  Aligning the power cord connector  
It is not recommended that you attempt to disconnect the power cord 
from the modem, unless instructed to do so by Customer Care.  
If you need t o turn off or power cycle the modem, simply unplug the cord 
from the electrical outlet.

way satellite antenna. Assemble and install the antenna assembly according to the 
antenna installation manual. If you do not have the antenna installation manual, 
refer to your Installation Reference Sheet to find the manual for your antenna on 
the installation support web site.  
 
   
When you install the antenna assembly, read and follow all safety alerts and 
instructions in the antenna installation manual and in the Antenna Site 
Preparation and Mount Installation Guide  (1035678- 0001).  
  
Installing the IFL cable  
Before you can point the antenna, you must route the IFL cable between the indoor 
satellite modem location and the antenna. Then connect the modem to the radio 
assembly with the IFL cable.  
Routing and connecting the IFL cable  
To point the antenna, you must connect the modem to  the antenna and install the 
DAPT2 (a Hughes tool that displays antenna pointing values).  
1. Route the IFL cable from the indoor satellite modem location to the antenna. 
The routing path depends on the building configuration. The Antenna Site Preparation and Mount Installation Guide  (1035678- 0001) gives guidelines 
for installing IFL cables. 
2. Connect the IFL cable to the connector on the radio transmitter. Use a temporary cable to connect the DAPT2 to the LNB which is part of the radio 
assembly as shown in Figure 16 . This is a temporary arrangement that is 
required for antenna pointing.30 Chapter 4  • Installing outdoor equipment and antenna pointing  
1041263 -0001 Revision A  
  
Figure 17: Connection of the DAPT2  
 
Note:  The connectors on the DAPT2 are labeled IDU and LNB. If the cable from the 
satellite modem (the IDU) and the cable from the radio assembly on the 
antenna are connected to the wrong connectors, the DAPT2 will not receive 
a signal. 
IFL grounding requirement  
The coaxial IFL cable and the ground block connecting them must meet the 
grounding requirements specified in the following warning:  
   
You must comply with applicable local codes and the grounding requirements 
in Field Service Bulletin (FSB), HNS Broadband Requirements for RG-6 and RG -
11 IFL Cable Connectors, Ground Blocks, and Ground Block Location  
(FSB_050518_01). Improper grounding can  result in electric shock injury, 
property damage, and/or poor modem performance.  
  
Labeling the IFL cable  
Label the IFL cable at the outdoor point- of-entry and at the indoor location where 
the satellite modem is installed as follows:  
Wrap a piece of blue electrical tape around the cable, and mark SAT on the tape.  
Connecting the IFL cable to the modem  
Connect the IFL cable to the connector on the rear panel of the modem as shown in Figure 17  which shows the placement of all connections.Chapter 4  • Installing outdoor equipment and antenna pointing  
1041263 -0001 Revision A  31 
  
Figure 18: All connections completed  
 
   
The cable connector must be securely tightened. Make sure each connector is 
properly aligned (not cross- threaded). The connector should be finger tight 
with no play.  
  
Make sure neither the satellite modem nor the customer's computer is connected 
to an Ethernet device.  
Do not connect any device to the satellite modem at this time except your laptop 
computer. Other Ethernet devices may only be connected to the modem after it 
installed and commissioned.  
Pointing the antenna  
Make sure you have the DAPT2. You will need this to point the antenna.  
1. Go outside to the antenna location.  
2. Follow the procedure explained in the Jupiter Antenna Pointing Guide  
(1039429 -0001) to point the antenna using the DAPT2. When you finish the 
pointing procedure, a screen message on the DAPT2 asks if you want to store 
the pointing information in the satell ite modem. If you answer yes, the 
modem exits pointing mode. When the modem finishes downloading the pointing information, the DAPT2 displays a Pointing Done  message.32 Chapter 4  • Installing outdoor equipment and antenna pointing  
1041263 -0001 Revision A  
 3. Make sure you see the Pointing Done  message on the DAPT2. Do not remove 
the DAPT2 until y ou see the Pointing Done.  
The following screens show the progression of pointing on the Terminal Installation 
screens.  
Coarse and fine pointing  
Coarse pointing refers to pointing the antenna in the general direction of the Jupiter 
satellite so that the antenna can acquire the satellite signal. Fine pointing refers to 
refining the antenna adjustment to point the antenna as accurately as possible.  
Figure 18  shows fine and course pointing in progress. Once pointing is complete, 
click Next  to continue.  
 
Figure 19: Coarse and fine pointing detail  
Pointing validation  
Once you have finished coarse pointing, use the DAPT2 to fine point the antenna. 
The Pointing Validation screen, Figure 18 , shows the validation in pr ogress.  
Ranging  
Ranging occurs when the HT2000W  measures the distance to the satellite to 
calibrate transmit power and timing. Once ranging is complete the HT2000W ’s 
transmit and receive signal are synchronized to the satellite for optimal transport servic e.  
Once the ranging process finishes, registering the modem begins automatically. See 
Prerequisites for commissioning  on page 35  for details on registering and 
commissioning the modem.Chapter 4  • Installing outdoor equipment and antenna poin ting 
1041263 -0001 Revision A  33 
 1. Remove the DAPT2 and connect the IFL cable from the satellite modem to the 
radio assembly. At this poin t the modem automatically begins the process of 
commissioning which includes registering with the NOC, and related activities.  
2. Go back inside to complete installation of the modem.Chapter 5  • Registering and commissioning the satellite modem  
1041263 -0001 Revision A  35 
 Chapter  5 
Registering and commissioning the 
satellite modem 
During commissioning, the modem interacts with the satellite to establish transmit 
timing and synchronization. It interacts with the NOC for authentication and 
registration; and to obtain required software, security keys, and a preliminary 
configuration. The NOC notifies the NSP that the satellite modem has registered 
with the network.  
The modem downloads a temporary configuration from the NOC. The temporary 
configura tion allows the modem to communicate with the NSP so the broadband 
service can be activated. Final configuration is provided to the modem after service 
activation. 
Prerequisites for commissioning  
The following are prerequisites for commissioning:  
• The satel lite modem must be physically installed.  
• The antenna must be pointed, and the modem must have exited pointing 
mode. Service for the modem must be configured by the service provider and the NOC, and the terminal site you entered. Installation must match the  
terminal site name configured by the service provider and NOC.  
• The satellite modem must be defined at the NOC and authorized for 
commissioning by the service provider.  
Monitoring the commissioning process 
Commissioning activities are performed automatically by the satellite modem, the 
satellite, and the NOC. Commissioning begins when the modem exits pointing mode 
and progresses until completion. Normally, there is no need for intervention.  
After you point the antenna and respond Yes on the DAPT to store th e pointing 
information, the modem exits pointing mode and displays the Terminal Initialization 
Sequence screen on your browser.  
The Terminal Initialization screen lists each commissioning activity and each 
activity's progress as the satellite modem procee ds through the commissioning (or 
initialization) sequence.  
Figure 19  shows the registration process in progress with several other activities 
underway. The activities occur in the order they are listed on the screen, top to 
bottom.36 Chapter 5  • Registering and commissioning the satellite modem

1041263 -0001 Revision A  37 
 Chapter  6 
Validating the installation  
As part of every HT2000W  installation you are required to validate the overall 
installation (modem, antenna, cables, and connections) using the Ka- band Onsite 
Validation Tool (OVT). This browser -based tool helps to ensure a high -quality 
installation. If the site performance is no t satisfactory, the OVT suggests corrective 
actions you can take and then analyzes the results of your actions.  
Important: Run the OVT on your installer laptop after the modem has completed 
commissioning and registration, but before the customer activates the HughesNet 
service.  
The OVT helps you obtain the best possible performance for a newly installed site 
by comparing current measured values from the site with target values. Before 
using the OVT, you must first complete the installation to the best of yo ur ability.  
The OVT is automated, but it does require certain information and actions from you. 
Online instructions and prompts guide you through the validation process.  
The OVT logs the measured values and corrective actions to the Installer Support 
database. When you successfully complete the OVT process, the tool issues a sign -
off code that you record on the Installation Reference Sheet.  
A quick look at the validation procedure  
This section summarizes how you use the HughesNet Ka -band OVT to evaluate the  
performance and quality of a newly installed HT2000W  site. For detailed 
information on the OVT, see Installer's Guide to the Ka- Band Onsite Validation 
Tool (OVT) (1038091 -0001).  
If for any reason you cannot access or use the OVT, call your installer suppo rt 
number. To access and start the OVT:  
1. Make sure your laptop computer is connected to the modem's LAN port.  
2. Navigate to the Advanced Pages Terminal Installation page.

For complete instructions on installing \nantenna mounts, antennas (including radio assemblies) and pointing, refer to the \nmanuals listed in Table 2 . \nThe HT2000W  satellite modem can be used with a 0.69 m, 0.74 m, or 0.98 m two -\nway satellite antenna. Assemble and install the antenna assembly according to the \nantenna installation manual. If you do not have the antenna installation manual, \nrefer to your Installation Reference Sheet to find the manual for your antenna on \nthe installation support web site.  \n \n   \nWhen you install the antenna assembly, read and follow all safety alerts and \ninstructions in the antenna installation manual and in the Antenna Site \nPreparation and Mount Installation Guide  (1035678- 0001).  \n  \nInstalling the IFL cable  \nBefore you can point the antenna, you must route the IFL cable between the indoor \nsatellite modem location and the antenna. Then connect the modem to the radio \nassembly with the IFL cable.  \nRouting and connecting the IFL cable  \nTo point the antenna, you must connect the modem to  the antenna and install the \nDAPT2 (a Hughes tool that displays antenna pointing values).  \n1. Route the IFL cable from the indoor satellite modem location to the antenna. \nThe routing path depends on the building configuration. The Antenna Site Preparation and Mount Installation Guide  (1035678- 0001) gives guidelines \nfor installing IFL cables. \n2. Connect the IFL cable to the connector on the radio transmitter. Use a temporary cable to connect the DAPT2 to the LNB which is part of the radio \nassembly as shown in Figure 16 . This is a temporary arrangement that is \nrequired for antenna pointing.30 Chapter 4  • Installing outdoor equipment and antenna pointing  \n1041263 -0001 Revision A  \n  \nFigure 17: Connection of the DAPT2  \n \nNote:  The connectors on the DAPT2 are labeled IDU and LNB. If the cable from the \nsatellite modem (the IDU) and the cable from the radio assembly on the \nantenna are connected to the wrong connectors, the DAPT2 will not receive \na signal. \nIFL grounding requirement  \nThe coaxial IFL cable and the ground block connecting them must meet the \ngrounding requirements specified in the following warning:  \n   \nYou must comply with applicable local codes and the grounding requirements \nin Field Service Bulletin (FSB), HNS Broadband Requirements for RG-6 and RG -\n11 IFL Cable Connectors, Ground Blocks, and Ground Block Location  \n(FSB_050518_01).

Make sure each connector is \nproperly aligned (not cross- threaded). The connector should be finger tight \nwith no play.  \n  \nMake sure neither the satellite modem nor the customer's computer is connected \nto an Ethernet device.  \nDo not connect any device to the satellite modem at this time except your laptop \ncomputer. Other Ethernet devices may only be connected to the modem after it \ninstalled and commissioned.  \nPointing the antenna  \nMake sure you have the DAPT2. You will need this to point the antenna.  \n1. Go outside to the antenna location.  \n2. Follow the procedure explained in the Jupiter Antenna Pointing Guide  \n(1039429 -0001) to point the antenna using the DAPT2. When you finish the \npointing procedure, a screen message on the DAPT2 asks if you want to store \nthe pointing information in the satell ite modem. If you answer yes, the \nmodem exits pointing mode. When the modem finishes downloading the pointing information, the DAPT2 displays a Pointing Done  message.32 Chapter 4  • Installing outdoor equipment and antenna pointing  \n1041263 -0001 Revision A  \n 3.

Do not remove \nthe DAPT2 until y ou see the Pointing Done.  \nThe following screens show the progression of pointing on the Terminal Installation \nscreens.  \nCoarse and fine pointing  \nCoarse pointing refers to pointing the antenna in the general direction of the Jupiter \nsatellite so that the antenna can acquire the satellite signal. Fine pointing refers to \nrefining the antenna adjustment to point the antenna as accurately as possible.  \nFigure 18  shows fine and course pointing in progress. Once pointing is complete, \nclick Next  to continue.  \n \nFigure 19: Coarse and fine pointing detail  \nPointing validation  \nOnce you have finished coarse pointing, use the DAPT2 to fine point the antenna. \nThe Pointing Validation screen, Figure 18 , shows the validation in pr ogress.  \nRanging  \nRanging occurs when the HT2000W  measures the distance to the satellite to \ncalibrate transmit power and timing. Once ranging is complete the HT2000W ’s \ntransmit and receive signal are synchronized to the satellite for optimal transport servic e.  \nOnce the ranging process finishes, registering the modem begins automatically. See \nPrerequisites for commissioning  on page 35  for details on registering and \ncommissioning the modem.Chapter 4  • Installing outdoor equipment and antenna poin ting \n1041263 -0001 Revision A  33 \n 1.

It interacts with the NOC for authentication and \nregistration; and to obtain required software, security keys, and a preliminary \nconfiguration. The NOC notifies the NSP that the satellite modem has registered \nwith the network.  \nThe modem downloads a temporary configuration from the NOC. The temporary \nconfigura tion allows the modem to communicate with the NSP so the broadband \nservice can be activated. Final configuration is provided to the modem after service \nactivation. \nPrerequisites for commissioning  \nThe following are prerequisites for commissioning:  \n• The satel lite modem must be physically installed.  \n• The antenna must be pointed, and the modem must have exited pointing \nmode. Service for the modem must be configured by the service provider and the NOC, and the terminal site you entered. Installation must match the  \nterminal site name configured by the service provider and NOC.  \n• The satellite modem must be defined at the NOC and authorized for \ncommissioning by the service provider.  \nMonitoring the commissioning process \nCommissioning activities are performed automatically by the satellite modem, the \nsatellite, and the NOC. Commissioning begins when the modem exits pointing mode \nand progresses until completion. Normally, there is no need for intervention.  \nAfter you point the antenna and respond Yes on the DAPT to store th e pointing \ninformation, the modem exits pointing mode and displays the Terminal Initialization \nSequence screen on your browser.  \nThe Terminal Initialization screen lists each commissioning activity and each \nactivity's progress as the satellite modem procee ds through the commissioning (or \ninitialization) sequence.  \nFigure 19  shows the registration process in progress with several other activities \nunderway. The activities occur in the order they are listed on the screen, top to \nbottom.36 Chapter 5  • Registering and commissioning the satellite modem  \n1041263-0001 Revision A  \n  \nFigure 20: Process in progress and completed  \n \nOnce the registration in complete, the Configuration process begins automatically. \nFigure 20  shows that Ranging, Registration, and Associating with Network are done. \nNotice that two links appear on the screen.  \n \nFigure 21: Registration and configuration processes  \n \nClick the Onsite Validation Tool link to begin the v alidation process.Chapter 6  • Validating the installation  \n1041263 -0001 Revision A  37 \n Chapter  6 \nValidating the installation  \nAs part of every HT2000W  installation you are required to validate the overall \ninstallation (modem, antenna, cables, and connections) using the Ka- band Onsite \nValidation Tool (OVT).

following sections for information that may help you discover the source of the problem and/or how to fix it.  
Connecting the modem power cord  
The HT2000W power cord connector uses a locking mechanism to ensure it stays snugly connected to the modem. Make sure the connector is oriented correctly when plugging it  into the DC IN port; the flat side of the plug 
should face the modem’s side panel  nearest to the port . 
Figure 10 shows the correct position of the  power cord connector. When 
connecting the power cord, you must push the connector into the DC IN 
port.  This creates a locking connection between the power cord and the 
modem.
