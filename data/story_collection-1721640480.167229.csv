How do I manage my built -in Wi- Fi 
modem ? 
1. Type 192.168.0.1  into any web browser connected (wirelessly or via 
LAN cable) to your HT2000W.  
2. Click the Wi-Fi Settings  link mentioned on the previous page.  
3. Enter the default administrative password: “admin”  
4. Click the LOGIN  button.  
5. Here are some optional features of the Wi -Fi Settings:  
a. Modify the default SSID and password for both the 2.4GHz and 
5GHz bands.  
b. Enable and/or name the 2.4GHz and 5 GHz guest networks.  
c. Disable Wi- Fi from your HT2000W by unchecking “SSID enable” for 
each tab (2.4GHz, 2.4GHz Guest, 5GHz, and 5GHz Guest).  
d. View which devices are connected.  
e. Manage parental control features, port forwarding, etc.  
How do I pair my device(s) to my 
HughesNet Wi -Fi modem ? 
Manual pairing method:  
1. See the back panel of the HT2000W. Look for the sticker p ictured 
below:  
 
2. The SSIDs for both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks are listed.  
3. The password listed is the same for both networks.  
4. Using the device you wish to pair, search for either wireless network 
matching the SSID above.  
5. Connect to the network.  
6. When prompted for a password, enter the password exactly as it 
appears on the label on the back of the HT2000W, referenced above.  
Wi-Fi Protected Setup  (WPS)  
1. Put your device into WPS pairing mode (this step varies by device).  
2. Once your device tells you to, press the WPS button on the HT2000W.  
3. Your device should then connect to the HT2000W’s wireless network 
automatically.  
Troubleshooting  
If you are having trouble with the function of your modem, review the 
following sections for information that may help you discover the source of the problem and/or how to fix it.  
Connecting the modem power cord  
The HT2000W power cord connector uses a locking mechanism to ensure it stays snugly connected to the modem. Make sure the connector is oriented correctly when plugging it  into the DC IN port; the flat side of the plug 
should face the modem’s side panel  nearest to the port . 
Figure 10 shows the correct position of the  power cord connector. When 
connecting the power cord, you must push the connector into the DC IN 
port.  This creates a locking connection between the power cord and the 
modem.  
 
Figure 10:  Aligning the power cord connector  
It is not recommended that you attempt to disconnect the power cord 
from the modem, unless instructed to do so by Customer Care.  
If you need t o turn off or power cycle the modem, simply unplug the cord 
from the electrical outlet.  
Computer Requirements  
The computer that connects to the satellite modem should meet the 
minimum requirements specified by the computer operating system manufacturer and  the following netw orking and browser requirements:  
• A web browser with proxy settings disabled  
• Device must be Wi -Fi compatible , or 
• Device must have an Ethernet port

below:  
 
2. The SSIDs for both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks are listed.  
3. The password listed is the same for both networks.  
4. Using the device you wish to pair, search for either wireless network 
matching the SSID above.  
5. Connect to the network.  
6. When prompted for a password, enter the password exactly as it 
appears on the label on the back of the HT2000W, referenced above.  
Wi-Fi Protected Setup  (WPS)  
1. Put your device into WPS pairing mode (this step varies by device).  
2. Once your device tells you to, press the WPS button on the HT2000W.  
3. Your device should then connect to the HT2000W’s wireless network 
automatically.  
Troubleshooting  
If you are having trouble with the function of your modem, review the 
following sections for information that may help you discover the source of the problem and/or how to fix it.  
Connecting the modem power cord  
The HT2000W power cord connector uses a locking mechanism to ensure it stays snugly connected to the modem. Make sure the connector is oriented correctly when plugging it  into the DC IN port; the flat side of the plug 
should face the modem’s side panel  nearest to the port . 
Figure 10 shows the correct position of the  power cord connector. When 
connecting the power cord, you must push the connector into the DC IN 
port.  This creates a locking connection between the power cord and the 
modem.  
 
Figure 10:  Aligning the power cord connector  
It is not recommended that you attempt to disconnect the power cord 
from the modem, unless instructed to do so by Customer Care.  
If you need t o turn off or power cycle the modem, simply unplug the cord 
from the electrical outlet.  
Computer Requirements  
The computer that connects to the satellite modem should meet the 
minimum requirements specified by the computer operating system manufacturer and  the following netw orking and browser requirements:  
• A web browser with proxy settings disabled  
• Device must be Wi -Fi compatible , or 
• Device must have an Ethernet port
